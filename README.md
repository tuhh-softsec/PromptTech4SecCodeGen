## Replication package for the paper: A Systematic Investigation of Prompting Techniques for Secure Code Generation


The repo contains two main folders:



* [LitReview-PromptingTechniques](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/PromptTech4SecCodeGen/tree/main/LitReview-PromptingTechniques): The data and results obtained from the literature review conducted to identify existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation are provided in the folder. It consists of the SLR results including the prompting techniques excluded from the final list.



* [Security-Analysis](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/PromptTech4SecCodeGen/tree/main/Security-Analysis): The data and results obtained from the security evaluation of prompting techniques for code generation are present in the folder. It includes code generated by GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, code validity analysis results, Bandit security analysis results and statistical test results.
